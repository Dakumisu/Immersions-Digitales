# TouchSweep

Super tiny vanilla JS module to detect swipe direction and trigger custom events accordingly.

This module works on touch-enabled devices only.

## Install

```sh
npm i touchsweep
```

or

```sh
yarn add touchsweep
```

or

just download this repository and use the files located in `dist` folder

or include it from unpkg.com

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/touchsweep"></script>
```

## Usage

```javascript
import TouchSweep from 'touchsweep';

const area = document.getElementById('swipe-area');
const data = {
	value: 1
};
const touchThreshold = 20;

new TouchSweep(area, data, touchThreshold);

// Then listen for custom swipe events and do your magic:

area.addEventListener('swipeleft', event => {
	// You have swiped left
	// Custom event data is located in event.detail
});

area.addEventListener('swiperight', event => {
	// You have swiped right
	// Custom event data is located in event.detail
});

area.addEventListener('swipedown', event => {
	// You have swiped down
	// Custom event data is located in event.detail
});

area.addEventListener('swipeup', event => {
	// You have swiped up
	// Custom event data is located in event.detail
});

area.addEventListener('tap', event => {
	// You have tapped
	// Custom event data is located in event.detail
});
```

## Options and default settings

The module constructor accepts three (3) arguments:

-   `element`: A HTML Element. Default is `document.body`
-   `eventData`: A plain JS object. Default is `{}`
-   `threshold`: How many pixels to count until an event is fired. Default is 40

## Supported Browsers

Currently all evergreen browsers are supported.
IE 10+ support is planned in the near future.
